        <h1>Dragon Haven - About</h1>

        <div class="about-text">
            <p>Dragon Haven is dedicated to preserving and sharing knowledge about dragons, the magnificent creatures
                that have captured human imagination for millennia. Dragons are legendary reptilian creatures found in
                mythologies worldwide, typically depicted as large, serpentine beings with the ability to fly and
                breathe fire. From the benevolent Chinese long that brings rain and prosperity to the fearsome European
                wyrms guarding mountain hoards, dragons represent power, wisdom, and the untamed forces of nature across
                countless cultures and stories.</p>

            <p>Our organization was founded by a group of mythologists, historians, and fantasy enthusiasts who
                recognized the need for a comprehensive resource celebrating these incredible beings. We bring together
                ancient texts, modern interpretations, and artistic representations to create a living archive of dragon
                lore. Whether you are interested in the historical roots of dragon legends, their symbolic meanings in
                different societies, or simply love the magic and wonder they inspire, Dragon Haven offers something for
                every dragon enthusiast to explore and enjoy.</p>

            <p>Through our website, we aim to educate visitors about the rich diversity of dragon
                species and their unique characteristics. We explore everything from their habitats and
                behaviors to their relationships with humans throughout history. Join us as we delve into
                the fascinating world of these legendary creatures, examining their roles as both fearsome
                adversaries and wise guardians in stories spanning from ancient Mesopotamia to modern fantasy
                literature.</p>
