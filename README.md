#Dragon Heaven : Multi-page Website


Here's your project README rewritten in first person:
markdown# Animal Website Project

## About This Project

I created a multi-page website about an animal using HTML and CSS to demonstrate the web development skills I've learned. The site includes a homepage, about page, and registration form.

## How to Run

To view my website locally:

1. Install dependencies (first time only):
```bash
   npm install
```

2. Start the server:
```bash
   node server.js
```

3. Open your browser and visit: `http://localhost:3000/`

4. Press `Ctrl-C` to stop the server when done

## Site Structure

My website consists of three main pages in the `public/` directory:
- **index.html** - Homepage with cards showcasing animal content
- **about.html** - Detailed information about the animal
- **register.html** - Registration form for user data

Each page includes semantic `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` elements with consistent navigation and branding throughout.

## Key Features

### Navigation
I implemented a responsive navigation menu that includes:
- Internal links (Home, About, Register)
- External links to relevant animal resources
- Keyboard-accessible navigation with either horizontal dropdown or vertical slide-in/slide-out menu

### Homepage
My homepage features:
- 7+ UI cards organized into two distinct categories
- 12-column grid layout with different proportions for each section
- Each card includes a heading, call-to-action link, and unique visual styling

### About Page
I wrote at least 3 paragraphs with detailed information about my chosen animal, focusing on readability and proper text hierarchy.

### Registration Form
My registration form includes:
- Name and email fields
- Checkbox and dropdown inputs
- Vertical (1-column) form layout
- Clear required field indicators
- Proper label associations for accessibility

## Design Approach

### Responsive & Adaptive Design
- Built on a 12-column grid system
- Responsive text wrapping from 360px width
- At least one adaptive breakpoint using rem units
- Pleasant reading experience across all viewport sizes

### Accessibility
I ensured my site is accessible by:
- Using rem units for all font sizes
- Making all interactive elements keyboard-navigable
- Adding descriptive alt text to all images
- Explicitly associating form labels with their fields
- Not relying on color alone to convey information
- Maintaining readable text with proper contrast and spacing

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

Throughout this project, I practiced and applied:
- Semantic HTML structure
- CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts
- 12-column grid system implementation
- Box Model understanding
- Responsive and adaptive design techniques
- Form creation and accessibility
- CSS organization with semantic class naming
- Position properties for layout enhancements

## Development Notes

I built this project following web development best practices:
- No external CSS frameworks or preprocessors
- No JavaScript (HTML/CSS only)
- Valid, well-formed HTML
- Organized, human-readable CSS
- Semantic class names in kebab-case
- No placeholder images or external image loading
